some notes:

oni-save-parser is not updated to the latest game yet. Note were 6 versions out and the last update to the repo was a year ago, it may not be maintained anymore.

Some fudging has do be done at present to get it to work with the latest.

Note: While writing this worker, it became apparent that it will not be possible to get some of the values in the game due to Klei's use of randomisation. It may be possible to replicate this in future, but for now I believe the best course of action, is to change course, and instead focus on creating a mod that is able to extract these values. 

It may be worth doing both, as the save parser seems to extract more data. However this introduces double complexity.
